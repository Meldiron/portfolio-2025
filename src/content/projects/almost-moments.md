## Vision

Something about going on trips with friends.. trips, birthdays, anniversaries, summer trips, winter tris.. Something about few people being easy to share photos and videos, but 10 and more people gets very tricky.. airdrop needs too many transfers, google drive needs app and an account.. there are apps for this but they cost upwards of 25€ per event.

Something about using immich, open source gallery app, but hosting it on VPS which creates monthly maintain cost.

Something about recent experiment with Imagine, AI web builder for anyone. Something about knowing this abstract a lot of knowledge about how to use AI, talk to it, skills, memories, and much much more. Something about me wanting to learn it in "low-level", without abstraction of any tools. Specifically wanting to learn with Claude Code, as it supports skills.
